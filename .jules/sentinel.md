## 2026-04-17 - Sanitized Redis Error Logging
**Vulnerability:** Potential credential leakage in logs via raw Redis error objects.
**Learning:** Default error objects in some libraries (like Redis) can contain connection strings including passwords if the connection fails.
**Prevention:** Always log only the `err.message` or specific sanitized fields when handling database connection errors, rather than the entire error object.
