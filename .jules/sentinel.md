## 2026-04-17 - Sanitized Redis Error Logging
**Vulnerability:** Potential credential leakage in logs via raw Redis error objects.
**Learning:** Default error objects in some libraries (like Redis) can contain connection strings including passwords if the connection fails.
**Prevention:** Always log only the `err.message` or specific sanitized fields when handling database connection errors, rather than the entire error object.

## 2026-04-18 - Header Length Validation
**Vulnerability:** Denial of Service (DoS) and cache displacement via oversized request headers.
**Learning:** Untrusted headers like `x-user-id` can be used to bloat in-memory caches or cause resource exhaustion if not size-limited at the application level, even if the reverse proxy has its own limits.
**Prevention:** Implement centralized middleware to validate the presence, type, and maximum length of critical custom headers before they reach business logic or caching layers.
