## 2025-04-18 - Optimized Session Management Implementation
**Learning:** Native `crypto.randomUUID()` is generally faster than the `uuid` package in Node.js 18+. Short-lived in-memory caching of Redis lookups (even for 5 seconds) can significantly reduce database load and improve response times for high-frequency repeated requests.
**Action:** Use native crypto and implement short-lived caching for session validation.
