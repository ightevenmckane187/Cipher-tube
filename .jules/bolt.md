## 2025-04-18 - Optimized Session Management Implementation
**Learning:** Native `crypto.randomUUID()` is generally faster than the `uuid` package in Node.js 18+. Short-lived in-memory caching of Redis lookups (even for 5 seconds) can significantly reduce database load and improve response times for high-frequency repeated requests.
**Action:** Use native crypto and implement short-lived caching for session validation.

## 2025-05-22 - Optimized CTA Cryptographic Processing
**Learning:** Redundant cryptographic operations (like hashing the same data 12 times in a loop) are a major bottleneck. Moving these outside the loop and using high-performance one-shot APIs like `crypto.hash()` significantly improves throughput. Additionally, replacing $O(N)$ array searches with $O(1)$ Map lookups yields measurable gains even for small datasets.
**Action:** Always identify invariant computations in loops and move them out; use `Map` for frequent lookups by ID/layer.

## 2026-04-30 - Optimized CTA Decryption and Structural Efficiency
**Learning:** Hoisting SHA-512 hash calculations when the input remains constant across loop iterations (like in the hash-lock verification phase) provides a significant performance boost. Additionally, pre-computing HKDF info buffers avoids repeated string-to-buffer conversions. Using a single `for...of` loop for Map construction is more efficient than a `.filter().map()` chain which creates multiple intermediate arrays.
**Action:** Always identify invariant computations in loops and hoist them; prefer single-pass iterations for data structure construction.

## 2025-05-15 - Optimized Entropy Generation and Buffer Concatenation
**Learning:** Consolidating multiple small `crypto.randomBytes()` calls into a single larger call and using `subarray()` for distribution significantly reduces the overhead of crossing the JavaScript/C++ boundary. Furthermore, reducing the number of intermediate `Buffer.concat()` calls by batching all parts of a cryptographic message into a single concatenation improves efficiency in hot encryption loops.
**Action:** Use a single entropy pool for multi-layer cryptographic salts/IVs; batch multiple buffers into one `Buffer.concat` call where possible.
