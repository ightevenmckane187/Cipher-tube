## 2026-05-24 - [Duplicate ID & Missing Feedback]
**Learning:** Duplicate HTML IDs (e.g., #theme-toggle) create accessibility violations and functional ambiguity for screen readers and scripts. Asynchronous actions (e.g., session extension) without loading states lead to user uncertainty and potential double-clicks.
**Action:** Always ensure unique IDs for interactive elements and provide immediate visual feedback (disabling button, loading text) for all asynchronous operations.
