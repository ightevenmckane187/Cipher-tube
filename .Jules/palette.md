## 2026-05-24 - [Duplicate ID & Missing Feedback]
**Learning:** Duplicate HTML IDs (e.g., #theme-toggle) create accessibility violations and functional ambiguity for screen readers and scripts. Asynchronous actions (e.g., session extension) without loading states lead to user uncertainty and potential double-clicks.
**Action:** Always ensure unique IDs for interactive elements and provide immediate visual feedback (disabling button, loading text) for all asynchronous operations.

## 2026-06-15 - [Keyboard Shortcut Hijacking & Discoverability]
**Learning:** Implementing global keyboard shortcuts (like '/') without checking if an input is already focused can hijack expected browser behavior or prevent users from typing that character into fields. Additionally, visual shortcut hints should be paired with `aria-keyshortcuts` to ensure discoverability for screen reader users.
**Action:** Always check `document.activeElement` before executing global shortcuts and use `aria-keyshortcuts` on relevant elements to expose shortcuts to assistive technologies.
